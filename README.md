# 🤖 AI Chatbot Development

An intelligent AI-powered chatbot built with **Python** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
The chatbot understands and answers natural language queries across diverse domains such as general knowledge, mathematics, weather, and news by integrating various APIs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Natural language understanding and response generation using Hugging Face Transformer models (e.g., DialoGPT)  
- Integration with multiple external APIs for enriched responses:  
  - Wikipedia API for factual knowledge  
  - WolframAlpha API for complex math and logic queries  
  - OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data  
  - News API for latest headlines  
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter for smooth user interaction  
- Modular and extensible architecture allowing easy addition or removal of knowledge domains
